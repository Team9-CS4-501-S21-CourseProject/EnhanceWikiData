One thing many people don’t know about actor Robert De Niro — known for his many infamous tough guy roles in films such as “Goodfellas” and “Taxi Driver” — is that he is a 15-year cancer survivor. De Niro was diagnosed with prostate cancer when he was 60 years old in 2003. But thanks to regular cancer screening which led to his doctors catching the disease early, the actor was treated swiftly — and was able to continue his prolific acting career.

Prostate cancer is really common in American men — 1 in 9 men will be diagnosed at some point in his life — and early detection is key. About 2.9 million prostate cancer survivors are currently living in the U.S. today. Fifteen years after beating the disease, De Niro was nominated for two Emmys in 2019, and he’s starring in Martin Scorsese’s new film “The Irishman” — the trailer for which just dropped today.
