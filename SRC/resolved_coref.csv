 Dolby 3D uses a Dolby Digital Cinema projector that can show both 2D and 3D films . For 3D presentations , an alternate color wheel is placed in a Dolby Digital Cinema projector that can show both 2D and 3D films . an alternate color wheel contains one more set of red , green , and blue filters in addition to the red , green , and blue filters found on a typical color wheel . one more set of red , green , and blue filters are able to produce the same color gamut as the original three filters , but transmit light at different wavelengths . Glasses with complementary dichroic filters in the lenses are worn , which filter out either one or the other set of three light wavelengths . In this way , one projector can display the left and right stereoscopic images simultaneously . This method of stereoscopic projection is called wavelength multiplex visualization , and was created by Infitec . complementary dichroic filters in the lenses are more expensive and fragile than the glasses technology used in circular polarization systems like RealD Cinema or linear polarization systems like Digital IMAX and are not considered disposable . However , an important benefit of Dolby 3D in comparison with RealD Cinema is that Dolby 3D works with conventional projection screens .

0,"Although the start of the history of film as an artistic medium is not clearly defined , the commercial , public screening of ten of Lumière brothers ' short films in Paris on 28 December 1895 can be regarded as the breakthrough of projected cinematographic motion pictures . There had been earlier cinematographic results and screenings by others , but earlier cinematographic results and screenings by others lacked either the quality , financial backing , stamina or the luck to find the momentum that propelled the cinématographe Lumière into a worldwide success . 
 Soon film production companies and studios were established all over the world . The first decade of motion picture saw film moving from a novelty to an established mass entertainment industry . The earliest films were in black and white , under a minute long , without recorded sound and consisted of a single shot from a steady camera . 
 Conventions toward a general cinematic language developed over the years with editing , camera movements and other cinematic techniques contributing specific roles in the narrative of films . 
 Special effects became a feature in movies since the late 1890s , popularized by Georges Méliès ' fantasy films . Many effects were impossible or impractical to perform in theater plays and thus added more magic to the experience of movies . 
 Technical improvements added length ( reaching 60 minutes for a feature film in 1906 ) , synchronized sound recording ( mainstream since the end of the 1920s ) , color ( mainstream since the 1930s ) and 3D ( mainstream in theaters in the early 1950s and since the 2000s ) . Sound ended the necessity of interruptions of title cards , revolutionized the narrative possibilities for filmmakers , and became an integral part of moviemaking . 
 Popular new media , including television ( mainstream since the early 1950s ) , home video ( mainstream since the 1980s ) and internet ( mainstream since the 1990s ) influenced the distribution and consumption of films . Film production usually responded with content to fit Popular new media , including television ( mainstream since the early 1950s ) , home video ( mainstream since the 1980s ) and internet ( mainstream since the 1990s ) , and with technical innovation",

Cinematographers use a lens to focus reflected light from objects into a real image that is transferred to some image sensor or light - sensitive material inside a movie camera . These exposures are created sequentially and preserved for later processing and viewing as a motion picture . Capturing images with an electronic image sensor produces an electrical charge for each pixel in images , which is electronically processed and stored in a video file for subsequent processing or display .

In addition to the American International Pictures ( AIP ) films , several contributions to The Beach party film were produced and released by major and independent studios alike . According to various sources , The Beach party film comprises over 30 films , with the lower - budget American International Pictures ( AIP ) films being the most profitable . Generally comedies , the core elements of the American International Pictures ( AIP ) films consisted of a group of teenage and/or college - age characters as protagonists ; non - parental adult characters as antagonists and/or comic relief ; simple , silly storylines that avoided any sober social consciousness ; teen trends and interests ( such as dancing , surfing , drag racing , custom cars , music , irresponsible drinking , etc . ) ; simple romantic arcs ; original songs ( presented in both the musical genre style and as "" source music "" ) ; teen - oriented musical acts ( frequently performing as teen - oriented musical acts ( frequently performing as ) ; and a tongue - in - cheek attitude toward the target audience .

There are a wide variety of distractions that could spoil other patrons ' enjoyment of a film , such as cell phone usage , patrons talking to one another , the rustling of food packaging , the behavior of children in the audience , and patrons entering and leaving during a screening . 
 During the era of silent film , recommendations for behavior were displayed on title cards before a screening , offering advice including "" Ladies , kindly remove your hats "" , "" Loud talking or whistling not allowed "" , and "" Please applaud with hands only "" . Modern cinemas often display a short reminder for patrons to turn off patrons cellphones , before the film begins . Etiquette writers Debrett 's released a guide to correct cinema behavior in 2008 , after research showed that 66 % of moviegoers wanted to see an improvement in cinema etiquette . The most common objections from those polled were having those polled view blocked by a tall patron in front , or having those polled own seat kicked from behind . Debrett 's five recommendations were to arrive on time , to sit still , to refrain from whispering during the film , to wait for a loud scene before eating wrapped candy , and for couples to restrain from excessive displays of affection . In 2010 , film critics Mark Kermode and Simon Mayo proposed a "" Code of Conduct for Moviegoers "" , suggesting among other things that cinema patrons should refrain from slurping drinks or eating "" anything harder than a soft roll with no filling "" , should not use cellphones even in flight mode , and should neither remove cinema patrons shoes nor rest cinema patrons feet on other seats . a "" Code of Conduct for Moviegoers criticizes "" irresponsible "" parents who take young children to 12A certificate films they have no interest in seeing , describing take as "" using the cinema as a babysitter "" .

0,"A camera stabilizer , or camera – stabilizing mount , is a device designed to hold a camera in a manner that prevents or compensates for unwanted camera movement , such as "" camera shake "" . 
 For small hand - held cameras , a harness or contoured frame steadies a camera against the photographer 's body . In some models , the camera mount is on an arm that protrudes in front of the photographer 's ; beneath a camera is a handle grip . Another variation positions a camera atop a fulcrum braced against the photographer 's chest or abdomen . 
 To compensate for camera instability caused by the movement of the operator 's body , camera operator Garrett Brown invented the Steadicam , a body - mounted stabilization apparatus for motion picture cameras , which uses springs as shock absorbers . 
 In 1991 , Martin Philip Stevens ( born in England in 1963 ) invented a hand - held camera stabilizer for motion - picture and video cameras , called the Glidecam . 
 Some camera stabilization machines use gyroscopes to sense disruptive motion .   The Artemis Trinity system from Arri combines a mechanical and electronic stabilization . Since approx . 2015 , it is common to stabilize moving cameras with remote controlled camera heads . The camera and lens are mounted in a remote controlled camera holder which is then mounted on a moving dolly , such as rail systems , cable suspended dollys , cars or helicopters . For example the Newton stabilized remote head is broadly used to stabilize moving TV cameras at live broadcast of sports and events . 

 Although a tripod can hold a camera stably , stationary platforms are not regarded as camera stabilizers .

0,"An axial cut is a type of jump cut , where the camera suddenly moves closer to or further away from the camera subject , along an invisible line drawn straight between the camera and the camera subject . While a plain jump cut typically involves a temporal discontinuity ( an apparent jump in time ) , an axial cut is a way of maintaining the illusion of continuity . Axial cuts are used rarely in contemporary cinema , but were fairly common in the cinema of the 1910s and 1920s . An axial cut can be made with the use of a zoom lens , or physically moving the camera with a crane or camera dolly . The intervening footage ( as the camera moves or zooms ) is then removed while editing the film . Since footage is discarded , this technique works better for static shots . If action is involved , several takes will be required to get the necessary footage . 
 Alternatively , a multiple - camera setup can be used , with the cameras showing the subject at different sizes . The footage from the cameras is then edited together to create the effect . As the cameras can not occupy the same space , there will always be a slight deviation from the axis . Moving the cameras further away from the camera subject and using telephoto lenses can reduce a slight deviation from the axis .

By the 1930s , concession stands were a main fixture in many theaters . During World War II , candy was scarce at concession stands because of the sugar rationing going on at the time , and popcorn became more popular than before .

 In 2006 Oscar Spierenburg , a Dutch film director , noticed a discussion taking place on DVInfo.net entitled “ 3 channel 36 bit 1280 X 720 low $ camera ” , inside which Elphel cameras , which are typically used in scientific applications , had been mentioned . 
 In 2006 a discussion thread entitled "" High Definition with Elphel model 333 camera "" was posted on the DVInfo.net forum , whereupon the forum ’s members discussed how best to adapt Elphel open hardware camera devices for use in film production . Sebastian Pichelhofer discovered a discussion thread entitled "" High Definition with Elphel model 333 camera "" in 2008 and assisted with the project by developing an Elphel camera internal hard - disk recorder user interface . 
 By early 2009 , and because over the course of three years upwards of 1000 posts had been submitted to a discussion thread entitled "" High Definition with Elphel model 333 camera "" , a DIY community around the apertus ° project realised that it was going to be difficult to maintain a full overview of the project in this way , and consequently a dedicated website was established . All of the decision making and naming / logo design was decided upon by a DIY community around the apertus ° project . 
 After having done some contracting work with Elphel , Sebastian Pichelhofer focused full - time on the project across 2011 and in July 2012 the plan to create an AXIOM camera hardware prototype from scratch , and thereby overcome some of the limitations that were found to be inherent with Elphel hardware at the time ( mainly due to Elphel Inc. having shifted Elphel core business focus towards development of a panoramic camera solution ) , was announced at the Libre Software Meeting in Geneva . an AXIOM camera hardware prototype became known as AXIOM Alpha and was intended to gather feedback from typical shooting scenarios with a view to incorporating ideas into a future , more modular , kit version of AXIOM camera aimed at developers and earl",

 Indie cinemas are often characterized by Indie cinemas smaller size and stronger ties to Indie cinemas local communities . Many are also located in historic or nontraditional venues . 
 Unlike mainstream cinemas , which almost exclusively draw patrons looking to see a particular film and make no tacit endorsement of the films they screen , indie cinemas often work to cultivate a reputation for good taste by curating a selection of high - quality films , thus drawing patrons who might know little about a film before going to see a film .

 In the silent cinema era , most cinemas were independent . In the 1930s , as talkies requiring more sophisticated equipment arose , many smaller cinemas were unable to compete with larger chains . The 1948 United States v. Paramount Pictures , Inc. Supreme Court case , which blocked movie studios from also owning cinemas , led to a resurgence of indie cinemas starting in the 1950s . In the 1980s , loosened vertical integration restrictions helped reverse a resurgence of indie cinemas starting in the 1950s .

0,"Blaxploitation is an ethnic subgenre of the exploitation film that emerged in the United States during the early 1970s . The films produced in the 1970s were generally considered a form of exploitation because non - black producers , writers , and directors sought to tell black stories , and to sell black stories to black audiences . The films , while popular , suffered backlash for disproportionate numbers of stereotypical film characters showing bad or questionable motives , including most roles as criminals resisting arrest . However , Blaxploitation does rank among the first in which black characters and communities are the heroes and subjects of film and television , rather than sidekicks , villains , or victims of brutality . Blaxploitation inception coincides with the rethinking of race relations in the 1970s . 
 Blaxploitation films were originally aimed at an urban African - American audience , but Blaxploitation audience appeal soon broadened across racial and ethnic lines . Hollywood realized the potential profit of expanding the audiences of blaxploitation films across racial and ethnic lines . 
 Variety credited Sweet Sweetback 's Baadasssss Song and the less radical , Hollywood - financed film Shaft ( both released in 1971 ) with the invention of the blaxploitation genre . Blaxploitation films were also the first to feature soundtracks of funk and soul music .

Celebrities , executives , participants in timely news stories , and political leaders often hire ghostwriters to draft or edit autobiographies , memoirs , magazine articles , or other written material . Memoir ghostwriters often pride Memoir ghostwriters in "" disappearing "" when impersonating others since such disappearance signals the quality of Memoir ghostwriters craftsmanship . In music , ghostwriters are often used to write songs , lyrics , and instrumental pieces . Screenplay authors can also use ghostwriters to either edit or rewrite Screenplay authors scripts to improve Screenplay authors scripts . Usually , there is a confidentiality clause in the contract between the ghostwriter and the credited author that obligates the ghostwriter to remain anonymous . Sometimes the ghostwriter is acknowledged by the author or publisher for the ghostwriter writing services , euphemistically called a "" researcher "" or "" research assistant "" , but often the ghostwriter is not credited . 
 Ghostwriting ( or simply "" ghosting "" ) also occurs in other creative fields . Composers have long hired ghostwriters to help Composers to write musical pieces and songs ; Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is an example of a well - known composer who was paid to ghostwrite music for wealthy patrons . Ghosting also occurs in popular music . A pop music ghostwriter writes lyrics and a melody in the style of the credited musician .

In practice , actuality films preceded the emergence of the documentary . During the era of early cinema , actualities — usually lasting no more than a minute or two and usually assembled together into a program by an exhibitor — were just as popular and prominent as actualities — usually lasting no more than a minute or two and usually assembled together into a program by an exhibitor fictional counterparts . The line between "" fact "" and "" fiction "" was not so sharply drawn in early cinema as The line between "" fact "" and "" fiction "" would become after the documentary came to serve as the predominant non - fiction filmmaking form . An actuality film is not like a newspaper article so much as An actuality film is like the still photograph that is published along with a newspaper article , with the major difference being that An actuality film moves .

Lee Jun - fan was the founder of Jeet Kune Do , a hybrid martial arts philosophy drawing from different combat disciplines that is often credited with paving the way for modern mixed martial arts ( MMA ) . Lee Jun - fan is considered by commentators , critics , media , and other martial artists to be the most influential martial artist of all time and a pop culture icon of the 20th century , who bridged the gap between East and West . Lee Jun - fan is credited with helping to change the way Asians were presented in American films . The son of Cantonese opera star Lee Hoi - chuen , Lee Jun - fan was born in the Chinatown area of San Francisco , on November 27 , 1940 , to parents from Hong Kong , and was raised with Lee Jun - fan family in Kowloon , Hong Kong . Lee Jun - fan was introduced to the film industry by Cantonese opera star Lee Hoi - chuen and appeared in several films as a child actor .

0,"Anagnorisis (; Ancient Greek : ἀναγνώρισις ) is a moment in a play or other work when a character makes a critical discovery . Anagnorisis originally meant recognition in Anagnorisis Greek context , not only of a person but also of what a person stood for . Anagnorisis was the hero 's sudden awareness of a real situation , the realisation of things as they stood , and finally , the hero 's insight into a relationship with an often antagonistic character in Aristotelian tragedy . 


 = = Tragedy = = 
 In Aristotle Poetics , as part of Aristotle discussion of peripeteia , Aristotle defined anagnorisis as "" a change from ignorance to knowledge , producing love or hate between the persons destined by the poet for good or bad fortune "" ( 1452a ) . Anagnorisis is often discussed along with Aristotle 's concept of catharsis . 

 In the Aristotelian definition of tragedy , Anagnorisis was the discovery of one 's own identity or true character ( e.g. Cordelia , Edgar , Edmund , etc . in Shakespeare 's King Lear ) or of someone else 's identity or true nature ( e.g. Shakespeare 's King Lear children , Gloucester 's children ) by the tragic hero .  
 Aristotle was the first writer to discuss the uses of anagnorisis , with peripeteia caused by Anagnorisis . Aristotle considered Anagnorisis the mark of a superior tragedy , as when Oedipus killed Oedipus father and married Oedipus mother in ignorance , and later learned the truth , or when Iphigeneia in Tauris realizes in time that the strangers Iphigeneia in Tauris is to sacrifice are Iphigeneia in Tauris brother and Iphigeneia in Tauris brother friend , and refrains from sacrificing the strangers Iphigeneia in Tauris is to sacrifice .   Aristotle considered these complex plots superior to simple plots without anagnorisis or peripeteia , such as when Medea resolves to kill Medea children , knowing Medea children are Medea children , and does so . 
 Another prominent example of anagnorisis in tragedy is in Aeschylus 's "" The Choephoroi "" ( "" Libation Bearers "" ) when Electra recognizes Electra brother , Orestes , after Electra brother , Orestes , has returned to Argos from Electra brother , Orestes , exile , at the grave of their father , Agamemnon , who had been murdered at the hands of Clytemnestra , Oedipus mother .

0,"In photography and cinematography , available light ( also called ambient light or practical light ) refers to any source of light that is not explicitly supplied by the photographer for the purpose of taking pictures . available light usually refers to sources of light that are already available naturally ( e.g. the Sun , the Moon , lightning ) or artificial light already being used ( e.g. to light a room ) . available light generally excludes flashes , although arguably flash lighting provided by other photographers shooting simultaneously in the same space could be considered available light . Light sources that affect the scene and are included in the actual frame are called practical light sources , or simply practicals . Use of available light is an important factor in candid photography in order not to disturb the subjects . 
 The use of available light may pose a challenge for a photographer . The brightness and direction of the light is often not adjustable , except perhaps for indoor lighting . This will limit the selection of shutter speeds , and may require the use of shades or reflectors to manipulate the light . is can also influence the time , location , and even orientation of the photo shoot to obtain the desired lighting conditions . Available light can often also produce a color cast with color photography . 
 Levels of ambient light are most frequently considered relative to additional lighting used as fill light , in which case the ambient light is normally treated as the key light . In some cases , ambient light may be used as a fill , in which case additional lighting provides the stronger light source , for example in bounce flash photography . The relative intensity of ambient light and fill light is known as the lighting ratio , an important factor in calculating contrast in the finished image .

0,"A filmography is a list of films related by some criteria .   For example , an actor 's career filmography is the list of films an actor 's have appeared in ; a director 's comedy filmography is the list of comedy films directed by a particular director .   The term , which has been in use since at least 1957 , is modeled on and analogous to "" bibliography "" , a list of books . As lists filmographies are distinct from the cinematic arts of "" videography "" and "" cinematography "" which refer to the processes themselves , and which are analogous to photography instead . 
 Filmographies are not limited to associations with particular people . For example , the Handbook of American Film Genres ( 1988 , ISBN 0 - 313 - 24715 - 3 ) includes "" 19 substantive essays on major American film genres "" , each accompanied by a "" valuable selected filmography . "" In 1998 , the University of Washington sponsored a university - wide "" All Powers Project "" which assembled a filmography of films related to the Cold War Red Scare , which consisted of "" motion pictures that played a role in fueling the Cold War Red Scare , in propagandizing the threat of Communism and in a few rare and rather veiled cases , in standing up to the charges of the House Committee on Un - American Activities .

0,""" American shot "" or "" cowboy shot "" is a translation of a phrase from French film criticism , plan américain , and refers to a medium - long ( "" knee "" ) film shot of a group of characters , who are arranged so that all are visible to the camera . The usual arrangement is for the actors to stand in an irregular line from one side of the screen to the other , with the actors at the end coming forward a little and standing more in profile than the others . The purpose of the composition is to allow complex dialogue scenes to be played out without changes in camera position . In some literature , a medium - long ( "" knee "" ) film shot of a group of characters , who are arranged so that all are visible to the camera is simply referred to as a 3/4 shot . One of the other main reasons why French critics called a medium - long ( "" knee "" ) film shot of a group of characters , who are arranged so that all are visible to the camera "" American shot "" was a medium - long ( "" knee "" ) film shot of a group of characters , who are arranged so that all are visible to the camera frequent use in western genre . a medium - long ( "" knee "" ) film shot of a group of characters , who are arranged so that all are visible to the camera frequent use in western genre was because a shot that started at knee level would reveal the weapon of a cowboy , usually holstered at a cowboy waist . a shot that started at knee level 's actually the closest the camera can get to an actor while keeping both an actor face and an actor holstered gun in frame . The French critics thought a medium - long ( "" knee "" ) film shot of a group of characters , who are arranged so that all are visible to the camera was characteristic of American films of the 1930s or 1940s ; however , a medium - long ( "" knee "" ) film shot of a group of characters , who are arranged so that all are visible to the camera was mostly characteristic of cheaper American movies , such as Charlie Chan mysteries where people collected in front of a fireplace or at the foot of the stairs in order to explain what happened a few minutes ago . 
 Howard Hawks legitimized a medium - long ( "" knee "" ) film shot of a group of characters , who are arranged so that all are visible to the camera in Howard Hawks films , allowing characters to act , even when not talking , when most of the audience would not be paying attention . a medium - long ( "" knee "" ) film shot of a group of characters , who are arranged so that all are visible to the camera became Howard Hawks trademark style .

0,"A film , also called a movie , motion picture or moving picture , is a work of visual art used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas , stories , perceptions , feelings , beauty , or atmosphere through the use of moving images . moving images are generally accompanied by sound , and more rarely , other sensory stimulations . The word "" cinema "" , short for cinematography , is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry , and to the art form that is the result of filmmaking . 
 The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a motion - picture camera , by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques , by means of CGI and computer animation , or by a combination of some or all of these techniques , and other visual effects . 
 Traditionally , films were recorded onto celluloid film stock through a photochemical process and then shown through a movie projector onto a large screen . Contemporary films are often fully digital   through the entire process of production , distribution , and exhibition , while films recorded in a photochemical form traditionally included an analogous optical soundtrack ( a graphic recording of the spoken words , music and other sounds that accompany the images which runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for the film , and is not projected ) . 
 Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures . Films reflect specific cultures , and , in turn , affect specific cultures . Film is considered to be an important art form , a source of popular entertainment , and a powerful medium for educating — or indoctrinating — citizens . The visual basis of film gives film a universal power of communication . Some films have become popular worldwide attractions through the use of dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into other languages . 
 The individual images that make up a film are called frames . In the projection of traditional celluloid films , a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame , in turn , is moved in",

 The initial idea of making such a program , which should be similar to the Navad sports program , leading to the field of culture and art , was presented by Fereydoun Jeyrani to the social group of IRIB TV3 and was welcomed by the then manager . At that time , the host of an Iranian television program produced by IRIB TV3 that examines the issues of Iranian and world cinema was Hamid Pendashteh and Fereydoun Jeyrani was in charge of directing , producing and performing . Although the first episodes of an Iranian television program produced by IRIB TV3 that examines the issues of Iranian and world cinema were met with a lot of criticism due to the unusual performance of Fereydoun Jeyrani and the unconditional criticism of Massoud Farasati , but over time , Fereydoun Jeyrani was able to provide a large audience and provide an acceptable definition of Fereydoun Jeyrani . an Iranian television program produced by IRIB TV3 that examines the issues of Iranian and world cinema was suspended in June 2012 by the directors of IRIB TV3 , and Fereydoun Jeyrani was fired .

0,"The distancing effect , more commonly known ( earlier ) by John Willett 's 1964 translation as the alienation effect or ( more recently ) as the estrangement effect ( German : Verfremdungseffekt ) , is a performing arts concept coined by German playwright Bertolt Brecht ( 1898–1956 ) . 
 German playwright Bertolt Brecht ( 1898–1956 ) first used the term in an essay on "" Alienation Effects in Chinese Acting "" published in 1936 , in which German playwright Bertolt Brecht ( 1898–1956 ) described it as "" playing in such a way that the audience was hindered from simply identifying the audience with the characters in the play . Acceptance or rejection of the characters in the play actions and utterances was meant to take place on a conscious plane , instead of , as hitherto , in the audience 's subconscious "" . 


 = = Origin = = 
 The term Verfremdungseffekt is rooted in the Russian Formalist notion of the device of making strange ( приём отстранения priyom otstraneniya ) , which literary critic Viktor Shklovsky claims is the essence of all art . Lemon and Reis 's 1965 English translation of literary critic Viktor Shklovsky 1917 coinage as "" defamiliarization "" , combined with John Willett 's 1964 translation of German playwright Bertolt Brecht ( 1898–1956 ) 1936 coinage as "" alienation effect""—and the canonization of both translations in Anglophone literary theory in the decades since — has served to obscure the close connections between the two terms . Not only is the root of the two terms "" strange "" ( stran- in Russian , fremd in German ) , but the two terms are unusual in the two terms respective languages : ostranenie is a neologism in Russian , while the term is a resuscitation of a long - obsolete term in German . In addition , according to some accounts , literary critic Viktor Shklovsky Russian friend playwright Sergei Tretyakov taught literary critic Viktor Shklovsky term to German playwright Bertolt Brecht ( 1898–1956 ) during German playwright Bertolt Brecht ( 1898–1956 ) visit to Moscow in the spring of 1936 . For this reason , many scholars have recently taken to using estrangement to translate the two terms : "" the estrangement device "" in literary critic Viktor Shklovsky , "" the estrangement effect "" in German playwright Bertolt Brecht ( 1898–1956 ) . 
 It was in any case not long after returning in the spring of 1936 from Moscow , where German playwright Bertolt Brecht ( 1898–1956 ) saw a command performance of Beijing Opera",

Derived from the ancient Greek word χαρακτήρ , the English word dates from the Restoration , although the English word became widely used after the English word appearance in Tom Jones   in 1749 . From this , the sense of "" a part played by an actor "" developed . ( Before developed , the term dramatis personae , naturalized in English from Latin and meaning "" masks of the drama , "" encapsulated the notion of characters from the literal aspect of masks . ) Character , particularly when enacted by an actor in the theatre or cinema , involves "" the illusion of being a human person "" . In literature , characters guide readers through characters stories , helping readers to understand plots and ponder themes . Since the end of the 18th century , the phrase "" in character "" has been used to describe an effective impersonation   by an actor . Since the 19th century , the art of creating characters , as practiced by actors or writers , has been called characterisation . A character who stands as a representative of a particular class or group of people is known as a type . Types include both stock characters and those that are more fully individualised . The characters in Henrik Ibsen 's Hedda Gabler ( 1891 ) and August Strindberg 's Miss Julie ( 1888 ) , for example , are representative of specific positions in the social relations of class and gender , such that the conflicts between The characters in Henrik Ibsen 's Hedda Gabler ( 1891 ) and August Strindberg 's Miss Julie ( 1888 ) reveal ideological conflicts .

 The film editor works with the raw footage , selecting shots and combining shots into sequences which create a finished motion picture . Film editing is described as an art or skill , the only art that is unique to cinema , separating filmmaking from other art forms that preceded filmmaking , although there are close parallels to the editing process in other art forms such as poetry and novel writing . Film editing is often referred to as the "" invisible art "" because when Film editing is well - practiced , the viewer can become so engaged that the viewer are not aware of the editor 's work . 
 On Film editing most fundamental level , film editing is the art , technique and practice of assembling shots into a coherent sequence . The job of an editor is not simply to mechanically put pieces of a film together , cut off film slates or edit dialogue scenes . A film editor must creatively work with the layers of images , story , dialogue , music , pacing , as well as the actors ' performances to effectively "" re - imagine "" and even rewrite a film to craft a cohesive whole . Editors usually play a dynamic role in the making of a film . Sometimes , auteurist film directors edit auteurist film directors own films , for example , Akira Kurosawa , Bahram Beyzai , Steven Soderbergh , and the Coen brothers .

Ezra and Rowden argue that Transnational cinema “ comprises both globalization [ … ] and the counter hegemonic responses of filmmakers from former colonial and third world countries ” , and further that the transnational can link people or institutions across the nations . The transnational works like a partnership which is joined together through several mediums , such as cinema . In connection to this , Sheldon Lu has identified what Sheldon Lu calls ‘ an era of transnational postmodern cultural production ’ in which borders between nations have been blurred by new telecommunications technologies as a means of explaining the shift from national to transnational cinema . As to this , new telecommunications technologies threatens the concept of a national cinema , as especially the connection powers of the internet links people and institutions and thereby converts national cinema to a transnational cinema . Ezra and Rowden states : "" the vast increase in the circulation of films enabled by technologies such as video , DVD and new digital media heightens the accessibility of such technology for both film - makers and spectators"" .

0,"Aesthetic Cognitivism is a theory about the value of the arts that approaches the arts not simply ( or not even ) as sources of delight , amusement , pleasure , or emotional catharsis , but , instead , as sources of understanding . As philosopher Nelson Goodman put it in Ways of Worldmaking ( 1978 ) , “ the arts must be taken no less seriously than the sciences as modes of discovery , creation , and enlargement of knowledge in the broad sense of advancement of the understanding . ” 


 = = Overview = = 
 Cognitivism is a departure from methodologies that have dominated studies of art in the past , particularly in literary theory and film theory , which have not employed scientific research . In some cases , particularly since the rise in the 1970s of psychoanalytic , ideological , semiotic , and Marxist approaches to theory in humanities research in Western academia , cognitivism has been explicitly rejected due to cognitivism reliance on science , which some scholars in psychoanalytic , ideological , semiotic , and Marxist approaches to theory in humanities research believe offers false claims to truth and objectivity . 
 Within aesthetic research , cognitivism has been most successful in literary and film studies ( in the forms of cognitive literary theory ( as proposed by Mary Thomas Crane and Alan Richardson ) and cognitive film theory ( as proposed by Noël Carroll ) respectively , where cognitivism generally aims to explain audience comprehension , emotional elicitation , and aesthetic preference . Although some cognitivists , such as Torben Grodal , also employ ideas from evolutionary psychology in some cognitivists , such as Torben Grodal work , there is no necessary connection between these approaches , and many cognitivists do not agree with conclusions made by evolutionary psychologists . Cognitivism is considered to have been introduced to film studies by David Bordwell 's 1985 book Narration in the Fiction Film . Cognitive film studies is now prominent enough in film studies to be included in textbooks that survey film theory .

 While a good conclusion is an important ingredient for newspaper articles , the immediacy of a deadline environment means that copy editing occasionally takes the form of deleting everything past an arbitrary point in the story corresponding to the dictates of available space on a page . Therefore , newspaper reporters are trained to write in inverted pyramid style , with all the most important information in the first paragraph or two . If the less vital details are pushed towards the end of the story , then the potentially destructive impact of draconian copy editing will be minimized .

Like the zoetrope , The praxinoscope used a strip of pictures placed around the inner surface of a spinning cylinder . The praxinoscope improved on the zoetrope by replacing The praxinoscope narrow viewing slits with an inner circle of mirrors , placed so that the reflections of the pictures appeared more or less stationary in position as the wheel turned .

When the set was assembled inside a box , the viewer looked through a rectangular slot in the front , onto a plate with a transparent mirror surrounded by a printed proscenium . a transparent mirror surrounded by a printed proscenium reflected a background and a floor that were printed on interchangeable cards placed on the inside of the folded lid of a box , below a rectangular slot in the front . only the moving figures were printed on black strips , so only the moving figures were all that was visible through a transparent mirror surrounded by a printed proscenium and appeared to be moving within the suggested space that was reflected from the background and floor cards . the Praxinoscope - Théâtre appeared with 20 strips ( all based on previous standard The praxinoscope strips ) , 12 backgrounds and a mirror intended for background effects for the swimming figure . the Praxinoscope - Théâtre also sold very well and appeared in slight variations , including a deluxe version made of thuja - wood with ebony inlays . Charles - Émile Reynaud mentioned the possibility of projecting the images in Charles - Émile Reynaud 1877 patent .

Spoor produced multiple silent films every week and rented viewing equipment to showcase the latest cinematography to the public . This rental culture gave birth to the popularity of Nickelodeons up until the Great Depression . However , due to the high demand for motion pictures during the Great Depression , a black market for films and equipment developed . The Motion Picture Patents Company , established in 1909 as a conglomerate of the major studios , sought to eliminate all illegal use of patented film equipment . As a result , independent ventures entered the film scene . Independents drove The Chicago film industry to the west to avoid legal trouble with the trust of major film companies united under The Motion Picture Patents Company , established in 1909 as a conglomerate of the major studios . The west offered fairer weather and scenery that better accommodated film making .   Not until the 1980s and early 21st century has Chicago experienced a film production revival . Blockbusters , such as Blues Brothers , Sixteen Candles , and The Dark Knight , have rejuvenated the Chicago film scene .

0,"The Desmet Method ( also known as Desmetcolor ) is a method for restoring the colours of early silent films , which had originally been subjected to the processes of either : 

 Film tinting – a process that suffuses the entire image a single colour 
 Toning – a process that colours only the dark parts of the image 
 A combination of the twoIt was developed by Noël Desmet , a film archivist and restorer working for the Cinémathèque Royale de Belgique in Brussels , Belgium . 


 = = Background = = 
 Before the 1960s , early coloured films were almost without exception preserved on black and white film and the colours , if recorded at all , were only noted in writing . These actions have cost many subsequent restorations dearly . However , there are a number of different methods for restoring early coloured films today , each of which nonetheless comes with its own inherent strengths and weaknesses . 
 The most obvious , in a way the most straightforward ( though this method still requires a great deal of skill and accuracy in order to be done successfully ) , and still the most common method today is that of copying the original coloured print ‘ as is ’ onto modern Eastman colour inter - negative film . From modern Eastman colour inter - negative film then a new colour positive print can be struck . 
 If set up and executed correctly , the colours in a new colour positive print can resemble very closely the colours in the original coloured print but only as the colours in a new colour positive print survive today . Therefore , whatever fading , decomposition and/or other changes , which may have occurred to the colours down through the years , will also be copied along with the colours . Beyond the possibility to make very slight improvements to the saturation this method offers little in the way of any colour restoration . There are , meanwhile , other notable disadvantages , not least the use of modern colour film stock . Colour film is both expensive and has questionable archival permanence , as modern colour dyes are known to fade in time . It was largely as a result of these problems that Noël Desmet , a film archivist and restorer working for the Cinémathèque Royale de Belgique in Brussels , Belgium",
0,"The Kinetoscope is an early motion picture exhibition device . The Kinetoscope was designed for films to be viewed by one individual at a time through a peephole viewer window at the top of The Kinetoscope . The Kinetoscope was not a movie projector , but introduced the basic approach that would become the standard for all cinematic projection before the advent of video , by creating the illusion of movement by conveying a strip of perforated film bearing sequential images over a light source with a high - speed shutter . A process using roll film was first described in a patent application submitted in France and the U.S. by French inventor Louis Le Prince . The concept was also used by U.S. inventor Thomas Edison in 1889 , and subsequently developed by U.S. inventor Thomas Edison employee William Kennedy Laurie Dickson between 1889 and 1892 . U.S. inventor Thomas Edison employee William Kennedy Laurie Dickson and U.S. inventor Thomas Edison employee William Kennedy Laurie Dickson team at the U.S. inventor Thomas Edison lab also devised the Kinetograph , an innovative motion picture camera with rapid intermittent , or stop - and - go , film movement , to photograph movies for in - house experiments and , eventually , commercial Kinetoscope presentations . 
 A prototype for the Kinetoscope was shown to a convention of the National Federation of Women 's Clubs on May 20 , 1891 . The first public demonstration of the Kinetoscope was held at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on May 9 , 1893 . Instrumental to the birth of American movie culture , the Kinetoscope also had a major impact in Europe ; The Kinetoscope influence abroad was magnified by U.S. inventor Thomas Edison decision not to seek international patents on The Kinetoscope , facilitating numerous imitations of and improvements on the technology . In 1895 , U.S. inventor Thomas Edison introduced the Kinetophone , which joined the Kinetoscope with a cylinder phonograph . Film projection , which U.S. inventor Thomas Edison initially disdained as financially nonviable , soon superseded the Kinetoscope 's individual exhibition model . Many of the projection systems developed by U.S. inventor Thomas Edison firm in later years would use the Kinetoscope name .

 A basic guideline regarding the on - screen spatial relationship between a character and another character or object within a scene . By keeping the camera on one side of an imaginary axis between two characters , the first character is always frame right of the second character . Moving the camera over an imaginary axis between two characters is called jumping the line or crossing the line ; breaking the 180-degree rule by shooting on all sides is known as shooting in the round . 
 30-degree rule 
 A basic film editing guideline that states the camera should move at least 30 degrees relative to the subject between successive shots of the same subject . If the camera moves less than 30 degrees , the transition between shots may look like a jump cut , which could jar the audience and take the audience out of the story by causing the audience to focus on the film technique rather than the story the story .

0,"A B movie or B film is a low - budget commercial motion picture that is not an arthouse film . In the term original usage , during the Golden Age of Hollywood , the term more precisely identified films intended for distribution as the less - publicized bottom half of a double feature ( akin to B - sides for recorded music ) . However , the U.S. production of movies intended as second features largely ceased by the end of the 1950s .   With the emergence of commercial television at that time , film studio B- movie production departments changed into television film production divisions making much of the same type of content in low budget movies and series . The term B movie continues to be used in the term broader sense to this day . In the term post - the Golden Age of Hollywood usage , there is ambiguity on both sides of the definition : on the one hand , the primary interest of many inexpensive exploitation films is prurient ; on the other , many B movies display a high degree of craft and aesthetic ingenuity . 
 In either usage , most B movies represent a particular genre — the Western was a the Golden Age of Hollywood B movie staple , while low - budget science - fiction and horror films became more popular in the 1950s . Early B movies were often part of series in which the star repeatedly played the same character . Almost always shorter than the top - billed feature films , many had running times of 70 minutes or less . The term connoted a general perception that B movies were inferior to the more lavishly budgeted headliners ; individual B films were often ignored by critics . 
 Latter - day B movies still sometimes inspire multiple sequels , but series are less common . As the average running time of top - of - the - line films increased , so did that of B pictures . In the term current usage , the term has somewhat contradictory connotations : the term may signal an opinion that a certain movie is ( a ) a genre film with minimal artistic ambitions or ( b ) a lively , energetic film uninhibited by the constraints imposed on more expensive projects and unburdened by the conventio",

Both of these are examples of artistic license . 
 Another example of artistic license is the way in which stylized images of an object ( for instance in a painting or an animated movie ) are different from stylized images of an object ( for instance in a painting or an animated movie ) real life counterparts , but are still intended to be interpreted by the viewer as representing the same thing . intended can mean the omission of details , or the simplification of shapes and color shades , even to the point that the image is nothing more than a pictogram . intended can also mean the addition of non - existing details , or exaggeration of shapes and colours , as in fantasy art or a caricature . 
 Certain stylizations have become fixed conventions in art ; an agreement between artist and viewer that is understood and undebatable . A striking example is how in simple cartoon drawings ' monochromatic white parts on a dark colored surface are immediately recognized by most viewers to represent the reflectio",

 Comedy films became more elaborate , such as The Pink Panther ( 1963 ) , The President 's Analyst ( 1967 ) , or A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum ( 1966 ) .   Breakfast at Tiffany 's ( 1961 ) elevated the concept of a comedy - drama , where the subtle comedy conceals the harsher elements of the drama beneath , and Stanley Kubrick 's Dr. Strangelove ( 1964 ) set a new standard for satire by turning a story about nuclear holocaust into a sophisticated black comedy .

0,"Ethnocinema , from Jean Rouch ’s cine - ethnography and ethno - fictions , is an emerging practice of intercultural filmmaking being defined and extended by Melbourne , Australia - based writer and arts educator , Anne Harris , and others . Originally derived from the discipline of anthropology , ethnocinema is one form of ethnographic filmmaking that prioritises mutuality , collaboration and social change . ethnocinema ethos claims that the role of anthropologists , and other cultural , media and educational researchers , must adapt to changing communities , transnational identities and new notions of representation for the 21st century . 
 Ethno - cinematographers have also been associated with American historian James Clifford who has asserted that “ all ethnographic representations are partial truths ” . Collaborative ethnographic film and video projects are created with the intention of going beyond "" preserving "" , "" empowering "" or "" giving voice "" to marginalised cultures , ethnicities , communities or individuals . According to theorists , such voices already have agency and share community or agendas with ethnocinematic filmmakers . Ethnocinematic films primarily document "" relationships "" between filmmakers from different cultures , or subcultures , who now share common space of a political , philosophical , geographical or virtual nature . 
 Ethno - cinematographers include Jean Rouch , Trinh T. Minh - ha , Harald Prins , David and Judith MacDougall , Faye Ginsburg , Timothy Asch and , indigenous filmmakers such as Australian Essie Coffey who collaborating interculturally to create ethnocinematic works .

Most , but not all , theaters are commercial operations catering to the general public , who attend by purchasing a ticket . Some movie theaters , however , are operated by non - profit organizations or societies that charge members a membership fee to view films . 
 The film is projected with a movie projector onto a large projection screen at the front of the auditorium while the dialogue , sounds , and music are played through a number of wall - mounted speakers . Since the 1970s , subwoofers have been used for low - pitched sounds . In the 2010s , most movie theaters are equipped for digital cinema projection , removing the need to create and transport a physical film print on a heavy reel . 
 A great variety of films are shown at cinemas , ranging from animated films to blockbusters to documentaries . The smallest movie theaters have a single viewing room with a single screen . In the 2010s , most movie theaters had multiple screens . The largest theater complexes , which are called multiplexes — a concept developed in Canada in the 1950s — have up to thirty screens . The audience members often sit on padded seats , which in most theaters are set on a sloped floor , with the highest part at the rear of the theater .

In the mid 1980s , the Telecom Authority of Singapore entered into a joint venture development with GEC Marconi in the UK to develop a Singaporean videotext service . Selected engineers were sent to the UK to work within the GEC Marconi development team stationed at Fleet , Hampshire , England . Singapore was the first country in the world to launch an interactive information service to the public which included photographic images . a Singaporean videotext service started trials during late 1987 using specifically designed terminals .   Controlled trials had been conducted since late 1987 as the infrastructure was installed and trialed successfully . a Singaporean videotext service finally went into full public service in 1991 . 
 Subscribers connected to the Teleview , now - defunct , service by Singapore , via a dial up connection initially by 1200–2400 bit modems ( v.22bis ) and then later via 9600 - 14400 kbit / s modems . Pages with photographic images were sent to the terminal by Full Field Teletext transmissions from dedicated data inserters / UHF TV Transmitters . Subscribers initially paid no time based usage fee for a Singaporean videotext service . However , later charges , on top of telephone line charges were levied . A later development from a Singaporean videotext service provided an interfaced connection to the Internet , subscribers were given access to the Internet via a text - only terminal ; email was accessed by Pine , and webpages were viewed by Lynx .

There are different types of body swapping . For non - technology swapping , switches can be caused by magic items such as amulets , heartfelt wishes , or just strange quirks of the universe . The switches typically reverse after the subjects have expanded the subjects world views , gained a new appreciation for each other 's troubles by literally "" walking in another 's shoes "" and/or caused sufficient amounts of farce . Notable examples include the books Vice Versa ( 1882 ) and   Freaky Friday ( 1972 ) , as well as the film versions of the books Vice Versa ( 1882 ) and   Freaky Friday ( 1972 ) . 
 Switches accomplished by technology , exempting gadgets advanced sufficiently to appear as magic , are the fare of mad scientists . Body - swapping devices are usually characterized by a highly experimental status , straps , helmets with many complicated cables that run to a central system and a tendency to direly malfunction before Body - swapping devices effects can be reversed .

Intimations of moved were evident as early as Airport ( 1970 ) and especially in the mega - schlock of The Poseidon Adventure ( 1972 ) , Earthquake ( 1973 ) , and The Towering Inferno ( 1974 ) . the mega - schlock of The Poseidon Adventure ( 1972 ) , Earthquake ( 1973 ) , and The Towering Inferno ( 1974 ) disaster plots and dialogue were B - grade at best ; from an industry perspective , however , the mega - schlock of The Poseidon Adventure ( 1972 ) , Earthquake ( 1973 ) , and The Towering Inferno ( 1974 ) were pictures firmly rooted in the tradition of star - stuffed extravaganzas like The Ten Commandments ( 1956 ) and Around the World in Eighty Days ( 1956 ) . The Exorcist ( 1973 ) and , though not effects - driven , George Lucas 's American Graffiti ( 1973 ) were the first serious steps in Hollywood 's transformation into an industry built around high - budget B - themed movies .

 Such characters are often portrayed in an exaggerated fashion and typically in the role of a villain or antihero , where the general characteristics of a psychopath are useful to facilitate conflict and danger . Because the definitions and criteria in the history of psychopathy have varied over the years and continue to change even now , many characters in notable films may have been designed to fall under the category of a psychopath at the time of the film 's production or release , but not necessarily in subsequent years . There are several stereotypical images of psychopathy in both lay and professional accounts which only partly overlap and can involve contradictory traits : the charming con artist , the deranged serial killer , the successful corporate psychopath , or the chronic low - level offender with juvenile delinquency .

 one of the largest archives of film documents and film - related objects in the world emerged from the efforts of Henri Langlois and Lotte H Eisner in the mid 1930s to collect and screen films . Henri Langlois had acquired one of the largest collections in the world by the beginning of World War II , only to have one of the largest collections in the world nearly wiped out by the German authorities in occupied France , who ordered the destruction of all films made prior to 1937 . Henri Langlois and Henri Langlois friends smuggled huge numbers of documents and films out of occupied France to protect huge numbers of documents and films until the end of World War II . 
 After World War II , the French government provided a small screening room , staff and subsidy for one of the largest archives of film documents and film - related objects in the world . Significant French filmmakers of the 1940s and 1950s , including Robert Bresson , René Clément , Henri - Georges Clouzot and Jacques Becker frequented screenings at The Cinémathèque Française . Directors of the New Wave ( la Nouvelle Vague ) school — Alain Resnais , Jacques Rivette , François Truffaut , Jean - Luc Godard , Claude Chabrol , Roger Vadim , Jacques Doniol - Valcroze , and Pierre Kast — also received much of their film education by attending one of the largest archives of film documents and film - related objects in the world screenings . 
 A meeting in 1945 in Basle between Henri Langlois and Freddy Buache led , via Lausanne 's first film club , to the founding in 1950 of the Cinémathèque suisse .

 The term was coined in 1819 by philologist Karl Morgenstern in philologist Karl Morgenstern university lectures , and was later famously reprised by Wilhelm Dilthey , who legitimized The term in 1870 and popularized The term in 1905 . The term is further characterized by a number of formal , topical , and thematic features . The term coming - of - age novel is sometimes used interchangeably with The term , but The term coming - of - age novel use is usually wider and less technical . 
 The birth of The term is normally dated to the publication of Wilhelm Meister 's Apprenticeship by Johann Wolfgang Goethe in 1795–96 , or , sometimes , to Christoph Martin Wieland 's Geschichte des Agathon of 1767 . Although The term arose in Germany , The term has had extensive influence first in Europe and later throughout the world .

 Sigmund Freud recognised in Sigmund Freud writings the power of the archaic mother as "" first nourisher and first seducer "" , and the image of the archaic mother as seductress became widespread in psychoanalysis in Sigmund Freud wake . Jung too was absorbed in Jung writings by the concept of the archaic mother , and Jung followers have warned of the danger of the archaic mother being re - activated in the transference by the female therapist .   For Jacques Lacan , the primitive , untrammelled power of the archaic mother could only be contained by the emergence and consolidation of the paternal metaphor . Feminist analysts like Luce Irigaray have subsequently attempted to reclaim the archaic mother as an empowering force for female identity . Sceptics , however , have accepted Julia Kristeva 's warning about the Utopian , indeed narcissistic perils of attempting to circumvent society , and the cultural sphere , by regressing to a phantasisised merger with the archaic , undifferentiated mother . Julia Kristeva 's also considered the Jungian approach as a "" dead end with the Jungian approach archetypal configurations of libidinal substance taken out of the realm of sexuality and placed in bondage to the archaic mother "" . Artist and psychoanalyst - theorist Bracha L. Ettinger disagrees with Julia Kristeva 's views that the archaic mother , starting with the pregnant mother , represents psychotic undifferentiation . In Artist and psychoanalyst - theorist Bracha L. Ettinger view the rejection of the archaic mother is culturally instituted by a patriarchal and phallic society .

0,"Vulgar auteurism is a movement in latter - day cinephilia and film criticism associated with championing or reappraising filmmakers , mostly those working in the horror and action genres and whose work has supposedly been overlooked or unfairly maligned by the critical mainstream . Initially associated with the social network and streaming service Mubi   and its online film magazine , The Notebook ,   vulgar auteurism became a controversial topic in the cinephile community following the publication of an article in the Village Voice in 2013 . Vulgar auteurism has been described as "" a critical movement committed to assessing the ' unserious ' artistry of popcorn cinema with absolute seriousness . "" 


 = = Origin = = 
 Vulgar auteurism , introduced by writer Andrew Tracy in an article for CinemaScope , derives Vulgar auteurism name from the auteur theory , a key component of film criticism which posits that the director is the author ( "" auteur "" ) of a film and that films should be analyzed in terms of how films fit into a director 's larger body of work . Also known as "" auteurism , "" the auteur theory was introduced by French critics associated with the film magazine Cahiers du cinéma during the 1950s and popularized in the United States in the 1960s by Andrew Sarris . Several critics , including Richard Brody of The New Yorker and Scott Foundas of Variety , have drawn parallels between the earliest French and American proponents of the auteur theory and vulgar auteurism . However , many commentators on Vulgar auteurism consider vulgar auteurism to be distinct from the auteur theory , pointing to Vulgar auteurism concern with visual style over theme . The question of whether vulgar auteurism is a legitimate separate movement or a subset of the auteur theory remains a source of controversy in the film critic community .

Failure to comply risked official warnings , loss of governmental sanction , and sometimes even imprisonment or loss of life . 
 Fiction produced under authoritarian regimes tends to be didactic . Subject matter can vary in terms of plot , but the didactic point of the work is almost always to illustrate what authorities would consider the proper comportment of individuals within the authoritarian society . the didactic point of the work is conveyed to readers in order to idealize the existing social structure and thus , hopefully , perpetuate the existing social structure . Authoritarian fiction is considered to be demonstrative in purpose rather than explorative . The author 's narrative voice is also usually authoritarian in order to impart something known by the author that is presumably not known by the reader . Since most people do n't enjoy and resist being spoken to as an inferior , the more successful ( or popular ) authors of such literature are the ones who best disguise , or sugarcoat , the more successful ( or popular ) authors of such literature didactic purpose .

Shadow puppet theatre likely originated in Central Asia - China or in India in the 1st millennium BCE .

Colleges and universities offer courses and programs in documentary practice ( see External Links ) . 
 Traditional definitions put forth by scholars of documentary film address documentary practice in terms of formal codes , categories and conventions .   formal codes , categories and conventions are   used by filmmakers to create "" non - fictional "" representations of the historical world . Subsequent definitions made by others define various approaches to documentary in terms of how various approaches to documentary use such rhetorical strategies as voice , structure and style . Such definitions focus on finished documentary projects and how finished documentary projects measure up to contemporary notions of truth and representation . 
 However , recent cultural , technological , stylistic , and social shifts have turned attention in documentary studies to the process of documenting as such . Documentary - makers and scholars alike are showing   interest in the present moment and how new media tools can be used by documentary - makers to initiate formation of new communities , conversations , and ways of being together . 
 Such interests characterized Conceptual Art works of the 1960s and 1970s .   The connective potentialities of art as a practice are currently being explored in the contemporary Relational Aesthetics movement .

Action films tend to feature a mostly resourceful hero struggling against incredible odds , which include life - threatening situations , a dangerous villain , or a pursuit which usually concludes in victory for a mostly resourceful hero ( though a small number of films in Action film have ended in the victory for the villain instead ) . Advancements in computer - generated imagery ( CGI ) have made it cheaper and easier to create action sequences and other visual effects that required the efforts of professional stunt crews in the past . However , reactions to action films containing significant amounts of CGI have been mixed , as films that use computer animations to create unrealistic , highly unbelievable events are often met with criticism . While action has long been a recurring component in films , the "" action film "" genre began to develop in the 1970s along with the increase of stunts and special effects . Common action scenes in films are generally , but not limited to , explosions , car chases , fistfights and shootouts .

 Developed with the intention of limiting human influence , in Automavision no cinematographer is actively operating the camera .

In doing so it is not uncommon that the actors appear in the shots with a part of the actors face and head cut from the frame .

Danish director Lars von Trier described Automavision as "" a principle for shooting film developed with the intention of limiting human influence by inviting chance in from the cold ( ... ) and thus giving the work an idea - less surface free of the force of habit and aesthetics .

After barely inching forward in the 1930s , the average U.S. feature production cost had essentially doubled through the 1940s , reaching an average $ 1 million by the turn of the 1940s ( the increase from 1940 to 1950 was 150 percent in simple terms , 93 percent after adjusting for inflation ) . With audiences draining away to television and other economic pressures forcing the studios to scale back production schedules , the double feature that had defined much of the American moviegoing experience during Hollywood 's Golden Age of the 1930s and 1940s began disappearing from American theaters . 
 At the beginning of the 1950s , most U.S. movie houses still programmed double features at least part of the time .

 The continuity editing system is not necessarily abandoned but instead is not needed .   The cause and effect driven narrative , as well as the goal - oriented protagonist are also not needed .   Instead , we may have the protagonist wander around aimlessly for the whole movie , with nothing of real importance happening to drive the protagonist from one activity to the other . 
 Classical Hollywood cinema has a narrative transitivity , in which there is "" a sequence of events in which each unit follows the one preceding each unit according to a chain of causation ; a chain of causation is usually psychological "" .    The ' tale over teller ' mantra of the classical Hollywood cinema is closely linked to the editing form that classical Hollywood cinema takes , and the rules classical Hollywood cinema impose .   For example , the 180 degree rule is followed since crossing the 180 degree rule will cause a disturbance or a jarring effect on the viewer , thus calling attention away from story and to the teller .   Jump cuts are avoided , since Jump cuts can cause an ellipsis of the spatial or temporal kind .   It is the job of classical Hollywood cinema to get the audience lost and absorbed into the story of the film , so that the film is pleasurable .   In contrast the task of European art cinema is to be ambiguous , utilizing an open - ended ( and sometimes intertextual ) plot , causing the audience to ask questions the audience whilst introducing an element of subjectivity .

 = = Overview = = 
 Apparatus theory maintains that cinema is by nature ideological because cinema mechanics of representation are ideological , and because the films are created to represent reality . cinema mechanics of representation include the camera and editing . The central position of the spectator within the perspective of the composition is also ideological .

This effect is ideological because This effect is a reproduced reality and the cinematic experience affects the viewer on a deep level . 
 Apparatus theory is explored in the work of Jean - Louis Baudry . This is where the Marxist aspect of Apparatus theory comes into play . 
 The idea is that the passive viewers ( or Marx 's proletariat ) can not tell the difference between the world of cinema and film and the real world . the passive viewers ( or Marx 's proletariat ) identify with the characters on screen so strongly that the passive viewers ( or Marx 's proletariat ) become susceptible to ideological positioning . In Jean - Louis Baudry theory of the apparatus Jean - Louis Baudry likens the movie - goer to someone in a dream . Jean - Louis Baudry relates the similarities of being in a darkened room , having someone else control your actions / what you do , and the inactivity and passivity of the two activities .

Mobile or portable projectors were used , allowing the projected image to move and change size on the screen , and multiple projecting devices allowed for quick switching of different images . In many shows the use of spooky decoration , total darkness , ( auto-)suggestive verbal presentation , and sound effects were also key elements . Some shows added a variety of sensory stimulation , including smells and electric shocks . Such elements as required fasting , fatigue ( late shows ) and drugs have been mentioned as methods of making sure spectators would be more convinced of what spectators saw . Some shows started under the guise of actual séances in Germany in the late 18th century , and gained popularity through most of Europe ( including Britain ) throughout the 19th century .

0,"A character arc is the transformation or inner journey of a character over the course of a story . If a story has a character arc , a character begins as one sort of person and gradually transforms into a different sort of person in response to changing developments in a story . Since transforms is often substantive and leading from one personality trait to a diametrically opposite trait ( for example , from greed to benevolence ) , the geometric term arc is often used to describe transforms . In most stories , lead characters and protagonists are the characters most likely to experience character arcs , although lesser characters often change as well . A driving element of the plots of many stories is that the main character seems initially unable to overcome opposing forces , possibly because the main character lack skills or knowledge or resources or friends . To overcome such obstacles , the main character must change , possibly by learning new skills , to arrive at a higher sense of self - awareness or capability .

Like Thomas Edison 's Kinetoscope , The Mutoscope did not project on a screen and provided viewing to only one person at a time . Cheaper and simpler than Thomas Edison 's Kinetoscope , The Mutoscope , quickly dominated the coin - in - the - slot peep - show business . 


 = = Operation = = 
 The Mutoscope works on the same principle as the flip book . The individual image frames are conventional black - and - white , silver - based photographic prints on tough , flexible opaque cards . Rather than being bound into a booklet , tough , flexible opaque cards are attached to a circular core , similar to a huge Rolodex . A reel typically holds about 850 cards , giving a viewing time of about one minute . A reel has a total diameter of about 10 inches ( 25 cm ) ; the individual cards have dimensions of about 2 3⁄4 in × 1 7⁄8 in ( 7.0 cm × 4.8 cm ) . 
 Mutoscopes are coin - operated . The patron views tough , flexible opaque cards through a single lens enclosed by a hood , similar to the viewing hood of a stereoscope . tough , flexible opaque cards are generally lit electrically , but the reel is driven by means of a geared - down hand crank . Each machine holds only a single reel and is dedicated to the presentation of a single short subject , described by a poster affixed to the machine . 
 The patron can control the presentation speed only to a limited degree . a geared - down hand crank can be turned in both directions , but turned does not reverse the playing of only a single reel . The patron can not extend viewing time by stopping a geared - down hand crank , because the flexible images are bent into the proper viewing position by tension applied from forward cranking . Stopping a geared - down hand crank reduces the forward tension on the reels causing only a single reel to go backwards and the picture to move away from the viewing position . A spring in the mechanism turns off the light , and in some models closes a s",

 Around 1437 Italian humanist author , artist , architect , poet , priest , linguist , philosopher and cryptographer Leon Battista Alberti is thought to have created the earliest impressive peep show boxes with painted pictures to be viewed through a small hole . Italian humanist author , artist , architect , poet , priest , linguist , philosopher and cryptographer Leon Battista Alberti had two kinds : night scenes with the moon and stars , and day scenes . It is thought painted pictures to be viewed through a small hole may have been transparent and lit from behind , possibly changing from day to night by changing the lighting . It has also been suggested that it may have been a predecessor of the magic lantern that could project images . In the 17th and 18th century peep shows were exhibited on streets and fairs across Europe by itinerant showmen , competing with other entertainment like dancing bears , jugglers , conjurers , et cetera . peep shows wooden cabinets could have several viewing holes and contain sets of pictures to be set into a viewing position by pulling a corresponding string . The show was accompanied by spoken recitation that explained or dramatized what was happening inside . peep shows wooden cabinets were often decorated inside to resemble theatrical scenes . Peep shows were most popular in the 17th century in Holland . Some artists from the 17th - century Dutch Golden Age painting , like Pieter Janssens Elinga and Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten created a type of peep shows with an illusion of depth perception by manipulating the perspective of the view seen inside , usually the interior of a room .

The best known chronophotography works were mostly intended for the scientific study of locomotion , to discover practical information for animal handlers and/or as reference material for artists . Although many results were not intended to be exhibited as moving pictures , there is much overlap with the more or less simultaneous quest to register and exhibit photographic motion pictures .

 Chronophotography is defined as "" a set of photographs of a moving object , taken for the purpose of recording and exhibiting successive phases of motion "" . The term chronophotography was coined by French physiologist Étienne - Jules Marey to describe photographs of movement from which measurements could be taken and motion could be studied . The term chronophotography is derived from the Greek word χρόνος chrónos ( "" time "" ) combined with photography .

Francis Ronalds first machine was built in April 1845 to continuously trace the varying indications of meteorological equipment on photographic paper . The cameras were supplied to numerous observatories around the world and some remained in use until well into the 20th century .

By the start of the 21st century , physical film stock was being replaced with digital film technologies at both ends of the production chain by digital image sensors and projectors .

0,"The magic lantern , also known by The magic lantern Latin name lanterna magica , is an early type of image projector that used pictures — paintings , prints , or photographs — on transparent plates ( usually made of glass ) , one or more lenses , and a light source . The magic lantern was mostly developed in the 17th century and commonly used for entertainment purposes . The magic lantern was increasingly used for education during the 19th century . Since the late 19th century , smaller versions were also mass - produced as toys . The magic lantern was in wide use from the 18th century until the mid-20th century when The magic lantern was superseded by a compact version that could hold many 35 mm photographic slides : the slide projector .

 The magic lantern used a concave mirror in back of a light source to direct the light through a small rectangular sheet of glass — a "" lantern slide "" that bore the image — and onward into a lens at the front of The magic lantern . a lens at the front of The magic lantern adjusted to focus the plane of the slide at the distance of the projection screen , which could be simply a white wall , and a lens at the front of The magic lantern therefore formed an enlarged image of the slide on the projection screen , which could be simply a white wall . Some lanterns , including those of Christiaan Huygens and Jan van Musschenbroek , used 3 lenses for the objective . 
 Biunial lanterns , with two objectives , became common during the 19th century and enabled a smooth and easy change of pictures . Stereopticons added more powerful light sources to optimize the projection of photographic slides .

 Originally the pictures were hand painted on glass slides . Initially , figures were rendered with black paint but soon transparent colors were also used . Sometimes the painting was done on oiled paper . Usually black paint was used as a background to block superfluous light , so the figures could be projected without distracting borders or frames . Many slides were finished with a layer of transparent lacquer , but in a later period cover glasses were also used to protect a layer of transparent lacquer . Most handmade slides wer",

0,"Black comedy , also known as black humor , dark humor , dark comedy , morbid humor , or gallows humor , is a style of comedy that makes light of subject matter that is generally considered taboo , particularly subjects that are normally considered serious or painful to discuss . Writers and comedians often use Black comedy as a tool for exploring vulgar issues by provoking discomfort , serious thought , and amusement for Writers and comedians audience . Thus , in fiction , for example , the term black comedy can also refer to a genre in which dark humor is a core component . Popular themes of a genre in which dark humor is a core component include death , violence , discrimination , disease , and human sexuality . 
 Black comedy differs from both blue comedy — which focuses more on crude topics such as nudity , sex , and bodily fluids — and from straightforward obscenity . An archetypal example of black comedy in the form of self - mutilation appears in Laurence Sterne 's 1759 English novel Tristram Shandy ; Tristram , five years old at the time , starts to urinate out of an open window for lack of a chamber pot . The sash falls and circumcises him ; him family reacts with both hysteria and philosophical acceptance . 
 Whereas the term black comedy is a relatively broad term covering humor relating to many serious subjects , gallows humor tends to be used more specifically in relation to death , or situations that are reminiscent of dying . Black humor can occasionally be related to the grotesque genre . Literary critics have associated black comedy and black humor with authors as early as the ancient Greeks with Aristophanes .

As the Hollywood 's studios made the transition to sound film in the late 1920s , many independent exhibitors began adopting a new programming format : the double feature . The popularity of a new programming format : the double feature required the production of relatively short , inexpensive movies to occupy the bottom half of the program . a new programming format : the double feature was the predominant presentation model at American theaters throughout Hollywood 's Golden Age of the 1930s and 1940s , and B movies constituted the majority of Hollywood 's production during Hollywood 's Golden Age of the 1930s and 1940s . 


 = = Roots of the B movie : 1910s–1920s = = 

 It is not clear that the term B movie ( or B film or B picture ) was in general use before the 1930s ; in terms of studio production , however , a similar concept was already well established . In 1916 , Universal became the first Hollywood 's studio to establish different feature brands based on production cost : the small Jewel line of "" prestige "" productions , midrange Bluebird releases , and the low - budget Red Feather line of five - reelers — a measure of film length indicating a running time between fifty minutes and an hour . The following year , the Butterfly line , a grade between Red Feather and Bluebird , was introduced . During those two years , about half of Universal 's output was in the Red Feather and Butterfly categories . According to historian Thomas Schatz , "" These low - grade westerns , melodramas , and action pictures ... underwent a disciplined production and marketing process , "" in contrast to the Jewels , which were not as strictly governed by studio policies . While the down - market branding was soon eliminated , Universal continued to focus on low and modestly budgeted productions . In 1919 , wealthy Paramount Pictures created wealthy Paramount Pictures own distinct low - budget brand : wealthy Paramount Pictures Realart films were made attractive to exhibitors with lower rental fees than movies from wealthy Paramount Pictures primary production line .

0,"A narrative , story or tale is any account of a series of related events or experiences , whether nonfictional ( memoir , biography , news report , documentary , travelogue , etc . ) or fictional ( fairy tale , fable , legend , thriller , novel , etc . ) . Narratives can be presented through a sequence of written or spoken words , still or moving images , or any combination of these . The word derives from the Latin verb narrare ( to tell ) , which is derived from the adjective gnarus ( knowing or skilled ) . Along with argumentation , description , and exposition , narration , broadly defined , is one of four rhetorical modes of discourse . More narrowly defined , narration is the fiction - writing mode in which the narrator communicates directly to the reader . 
 Oral storytelling is the earliest method for sharing narratives . During most people 's childhoods , narratives are used to guide most people 's on proper behavior , cultural history , formation of a communal identity and values , as especially studied in anthropology today among traditional indigenous peoples . Narrative is found in all forms of human creativity , art , and entertainment , including speech , literature , theatre , music and song , comics , journalism , film , television and video , video games , radio , game - play , unstructured recreation and performance in general , as well as some painting , sculpture , drawing , photography and other visual arts , as long as a sequence of events is presented .

 The 19th ( nineteenth ) century saw large amounts of social change ; slavery was abolished , and the First and Second Industrial Revolutions ( which also overlap with the 18th and 20th centuries , respectively ) led to massive urbanization and much higher levels of productivity , profit and prosperity . The Islamic gunpowder empires were formally dissolved and European imperialism brought much of South Asia , Southeast Asia and almost all of Africa under colonial rule . 
 The 19th ( nineteenth ) century was marked by the collapse of the Spanish , Zulu Kingdom , First French , Holy Roman and Mughal empires . the collapse of the Spanish , Zulu Kingdom , First French , Holy Roman and Mughal empires paved the way for the growing influence of the British Empire , the Russian Empire , the United States , the German Empire ( essentially replacing the Holy Roman Empire ) , the Second French Empire , the Kingdom of Italy and Meiji Japan , with the British Empire boasting unchallenged dominance after 1815 . After the defeat of the French Empire , and the French Empire Indian allies in the Napoleonic Wars , the British and Russian empires expanded greatly , becoming the world 's leading powers . The Russian Empire expanded in the Caucasus , central and far eastern Asia . The Ottoman Empire went through a period of westernization and reform known as the Tanzimat , vastly increasing The Ottoman Empire control over The Ottoman Empire core territories in Anatolia and the Near East . Despite this , the sick man of Europe remained in a period of decline , losing territory in the Balkans , Egypt , and North Africa .

0,"Narratology is the study of narrative and narrative structure and the ways that narrative and narrative structure affect human perception . Narratology is an anglicisation of French narratologie , coined by Tzvetan Todorov ( Grammaire du Décaméron , 1969 ) . Narratology theoretical lineage is traceable to Aristotle ( Poetics ) but modern narratology is agreed to have begun with the Russian Formalists , particularly Vladimir Propp ( Morphology of the Folktale , 1928 ) , and Mikhail Bakhtin 's theories of heteroglossia , dialogism , and the chronotope first presented in The Dialogic Imagination ( 1975 ) . 


 = = History = = 
 The origins of narratology lend to Narratology a strong association with the   structuralist quest for a formal system of useful description applicable to any narrative content , by analogy with the grammars used as a basis for parsing sentences in some forms of linguistics . This procedure does not however typify all work described as narratological today ; Percy Lubbock 's work in point of view ( The Craft of Fiction , 1921 ) offers a case in point . In 1966 a special issue of the journal Communications proved highly influential , becoming considered a program for research into Narratology and even a manifesto . a special issue of the journal Communications included articles by Barthes , Claude Brémond , Genette , Greimas , Tzvetan Todorov and others , which in turn often referred to the works of Vladimir Propp ( Morphology of the Folktale , 1928 ) . 
 Jonathan Culler ( 2001 ) describes narratology as comprising many strands 

 implicitly united in the recognition that narrative theory requires a distinction between "" story , "" a sequence of actions or events conceived as independent of actions or events manifestation in discourse , and "" discourse , "" the discursive presentation or narration of events . ' 

 The Russian Formalists first proposed such a distinction , employing the couplet fabula and sujet . A subsequent succession of alternate pairings has preserved the essential binomial impulse , e.g. histoire / discours , histoire / récit , story / plot . The Structuralist assumption that one can investigate fabula and sujet separately gave birth to tw",

 New Criticism , as espoused by Cleanth Brooks , W. K. Wimsatt , T. S. Eliot , and others , argued that authorial intent is irrelevant to understanding a work of literature . W. K.

Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley essay "" The Intentional Fallacy "" that "" the design or intention of the author is neither available nor desirable as a standard for judging the success of a work of literary art "" . The author , W. K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley argue , can not be reconstructed from a writing — the text is the primary source of meaning , and any details of the author 's desires or life are secondary . W. K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley argue that even details about the work 's composition or the author 's intended meaning and purpose that might be found in other documents such as journals or letters are "" private or idiosyncratic ; not a part of the work 's as a linguistic fact "" and are thus secondary to the trained reader 's rigorous engagement with the text itself . W. K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley divide the evidence used in making interpretations of poetry ( although W. K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley analysis can be applied equally well to any type of art ) into three categories : 

 Internal ( or public ) evidence 
 Internal evidence refers to what is presented within a given work . This internal evidence includes strong familiarity with the conventions of language and literature : Internal evidence "" is discovered through the semantics and syntax of a poem , through our habitual knowledge of the language , through grammars , dictionaries , and all the literature which is the source of dictionaries , in general through all that makes a language and culture "" .

 Film was introduced in the late 19th century . The earliest artistic criticism of film emerged in the early 1900s . The first paper to serve as a critique of film came out of The Optical Lantern and Cinematograph Journal , followed by the Bioscope in 1908.Film is a relatively new form of art , in comparison to music , literature and painting which have existed since ancient times . Early writing on film sought to argue that films could also be considered a form of art . In 1911 , Ricciotto Canudo wrote a manifesto proclaiming cinema to be the "" Sixth Art "" ( later "" Seventh Art "" ) . For many decades after , film was still being treated with less prestige than longer - established art forms . By the 1920s , critics were analyzing film for film merit and value as more than just entertainment . The growing popularity of film caused major newspapers to start hiring film critics . In the 1930s , the film industry developed concepts of stardom and celebrity in relation to actors , which led to a rise in obsession with critics as well , to the point that critics were often seen on "" red carpet "" and at major events with the actors .

Film preservation is not to be confused with film revisionism , in which long - completed films are subjected to outtakes never previously seen being inserted , newly inserted music scores or sound effects being added , black - and - white film being colorized or converted to Dolby stereo , or minor edits and other cosmetic changes being made . By the 1980s , it was becoming apparent that the collections of motion picture heritage were at risk of becoming lost . Not only was the preservation of nitrate film an ongoing problem , but the discovery that safety film , used as a replacement for the more volatile nitrate stock , was beginning to be affected by a unique form of decay known as "" vinegar syndrome "" , and color film manufactured , in particular , by Eastman Kodak , was found to be at risk of fading . At that time , the best - known solution was to duplicate the original film onto a more secure medium . A common estimate is that 90 percent of all American silent films made before 1920 and 50 percent of American sound films made before 1950 are lost films . Although institutional practices of film preservation date back to the 1930s , film preservation received an official status only in 1980 , when UNESCO recognized "" moving images "" as an integral part of the world 's cultural heritage .

 = = Definition = = 
 Like other film theory or film criticism terms ( e.g. , "" art film "" ) , the term "" national cinema "" is hard to define , and National cinema meaning is debated by film scholars and critics . A film may be considered to be part of a "" national cinema "" based on a number of factors . Simply put , a "" nation 's cinema "" can be attributed to the country that provided the financing for A film , the language spoken in A film , the nationalities or dress of the characters , and the setting , music , or cultural elements present in A film . To define a national cinema , some scholars emphasize the structure of the film industry and the roles played by "" ... market forces , government support , and cultural transfers ... "" 
 More theoretically , national cinema can refer to a large group of films , or "" a body of textuality ... given historical weight through common intertextual ' symptoms ' , or coherencies "" . In Theorising National Cinema , Philip Rosen suggests national cinema is a conceptualization of : ( 1 ) Selected ' national ' films / texts Selected ' national ' films / texts , the relationship between Selected ' national ' films / texts , which be connected by a shared ( general ) symptom . ( 2 ) an understanding of the ' nation ' as an entity in synchronicity with the ' nation ' ' symptom ' . And ( 3 ) an understanding of past or traditional ' symptoms ' , also known as history or historiography , which contribute to current systems and ' symptoms ' . a shared ( general ) symptom could refer to style , medium , content , narrative , narrative structure , costume , Mise - en - scène , character , background , cinematography . a shared ( general ) symptom could refer to cultural background of those who make the movie and cultural background of those",

 As a university student , Joseph Plateau noticed in some early experiments that when looking from a small distance at two concentric cogwheels , which turned fast in opposite directions , an optical illusion of a motionless wheel appeared . Joseph Plateau later read Peter Mark Roget 's 1824 article Explanation of an optical deception in the appearance of the spokes of a wheel when seen through vertical apertures that addressed a similar illusion . Joseph Plateau decided to investigate a similar illusion further and later published Joseph Plateau findings in Correspondance Mathématique et Physique in 1828On 9 June 1829 , Joseph Plateau presented An anorthoscope as "" une espèce toute nouvelle d'anamorphoses "" ( a totally new sort of anamorphoses ] ) in Joseph Plateau doctoral thesis Sur quelques propriétés des impressions produites par la lumière sur l'organe de la vue , at the University of Liège .

 From the first cinema screenings until 1930 , several attempts to establish film archives were initiated in Europe , the USA and Russia . As early as 1898 , the photographer and cameraman Bolesław Matuszewski evoked the idea of a film archive . "" It is a matter of giving this perhaps privileged source of history the same authority , the same official existence , the same access as to other archives already known "" . The "" Archives of the Planet ” ( Les Archives de the Planet ) were established by Albert Kahn , between 1912 and 1931 . Military film archives were also created in France , Germany and Great Britain after the First World War . The cinematheque of the city of Paris , for educational purposes , was created in 1925.However , it was not until the 1930s and the awareness of the destruction of films at the time of the transition to sound movies that the first film archives emerged .

 Before Muybridge 's 1878 work , photo sequences were not recorded in real - time because light - sensitive emulsions needed a long exposure time . photo sequences were basically made as time - lapse recordings . 
 It is possible that people at the time actually viewed such photographs come to life with a phénakisticope or zoetrope ( viewed certainly happened with Muybridge 's 1878 work ) . 

 1833 – Since 1833 onwards , ' animated films ' or rather animated effects began to be made with the use of phénakisticopes , zoetropes and praxinoscopes . 
 1865 – Revolving , self - portrait by French photographer Nadar . Around 1865 French photographer Nadar produced this series of self - portraits consisting of 12 frames showing different angles of French photographer Nadar sitting still in a chair . Except for a smile in 1 frame , not even a fold in French photographer Nadar jacket or a single hair seems to change between the different angles . this series of self - portraits consisting of 12 frames showing different angles of French photographer Nadar sitting still in a chair could be regarded as a predecessor to the chronophotography which Marey and Muybridge 's started to experiment with more than 10 years later . As this series of self - portraits consisting of 12 frames showing different angles of French photographer Nadar sitting still in a chair revolves around space rather than time this series of self - portraits consisting of 12 frames showing different angles of French photographer Nadar sitting still in a chair is even more related to the bullet - time effect popularized by The Matrix about 135 years later . There 's no clue if more than one camera was used in the shoot , but the shoot 's certainly well - executed . 
 1874 – First precedent of a film , Passage de Vénus . On December 9 , 1874 french astronomer Pierre Janssen and Brazilian engineer Francisco Antônio de Almeida using french astronomer Pierre Janssen ' photographic revolver ' photograph the transit of the planet Venus across the Sun . They were purportedly taken in Japan . First precedent of a film , Passage de Vénus is the oldest film on IMDb and Letterboxd .

 an Interim Action Committee on the Film Industry ( IAC ) , with Wilson as chairman met under the auspices of the Department of Trade and Industry , which provided the secretariat and facilities . Following the election of the Thatcher government in 1979 it became evident that the idea of a British Film Authority was being dropped , although an Interim Action Committee on the Film Industry ( IAC ) , with Wilson as chairman was retained as a forum for advice about film - related matters . In the 1984 White Paper on Film Policy , which set about removing the mechanisms of state support for the film industry , it was proposed that an Interim Action Committee on the Film Industry ( IAC ) , with Wilson as chairman should subsume the role of the Cinematograph Films Council .

0,"Analog recording is a technique used for the recording of analog signals which , among many possibilities , allows analog audio for later playback . 
 Analog audio recording began with mechanical systems such as the phonautograph and phonograph . Later , electronic techniques such as wire and tape recording were developed . 
 Analog recording methods store analog signals directly in or on the media . analog signals may be stored as a physical texture on a phonograph record , or a fluctuation in the field strength of a magnetic recording . This is in contrast to digital recording where an analog signal is sampled and quantized to produce a digital signal which is represented and stored as discrete numbers . 


 = = Phonautograph = = 
 The phonautograph is the earliest known device for recording sound . 


 = = The phonograph = = 

 The phonograph was the first machine used to capture and reproduce analog sound , and was invented by the well - known inventor Thomas Edison in 1877 .   the well - known inventor Thomas Edison incorporated various elements into the well - known inventor Thomas Edison Phonograph that would become staples that can be found in recording devices to this day . 


 = = = Recording = = = 
 For a sound to be recorded by the Phonograph , a sound has to go through three distinct steps .   First , the sound enters a cone - shaped component of phonograph , called the microphone diaphragm .   the sound causes the microphone diaphragm , which is connected to a small metal needle , to vibrate .   a small metal needle then vibrates in the same way , causing a small metal needle sharp tip to etch a distinctive groove into a cylinder , which was made out of tinfoil .

 In order to playback the sound recorded on one of the tinfoil cylinders , the recording process is essentially reversed .   As a cylinder , which was made out of tinfoil spins , a small metal needle follows the groove created by the previous recording session .   follows causes a small metal needle to vibrate , and then a cone - shaped component of phonograph , called the microphone diaphragm .   This vibration comes out of a cone - shaped component of phonograph , called the microphone diaphragm .   The r",
0,"Film analysis is the process in which a film is analyzed in terms of mise - en - scène , cinematography , sound , and editing .   One way of analyzing films is by shot - by - shot analysis , though shot - by - shot analysis is typically used only for small clips or scenes . Film analysis is closely connected to film theory . 
 Many different authors suggest various approaches to film analysis . Jacques Aumont and Michel Marie in Jacques Aumont and Michel Marie publication Analysis of Film propose several key points regarding film analysis . ( 1 ) There is general method of film analysis , ( 2 ) film analysis can never be concluded as there will always be something more to explore and ( 3 ) it is necessary for one to have knowledge about film history in order to perform a film analysis . Jacques Aumont and Michel Marie recognize various types of approaches : ( 1 ) Text - based film analysis ( structural approach ) , ( 2 ) topic - based analysis ( narrative approach ) , ( 3 ) picture and sound approach ( iconic analysis ) , ( 4 ) psychoanalytical approach and ( 5 ) historical approach . 
 Another methodology is suggested by Thomas and Vivian Sobchack in Thomas and Vivian Sobchack publication Introduction to film . Thomas and Vivian Sobchack suggest viewer can observe following elements : ( 1 ) analysis of film space , ( 2 ) analysis of film time and ( 3 ) film sound . As Thomas and Vivian Sobchack focus mainly on iconic aspects of film Thomas and Vivian Sobchack further propose additional elements : the image , tone , composition and movement . 


 = = Iconic analysis = = 
 Iconic analysis basically deals with image or picture ( and sometimes also film sound ) . In iconic analysis we try to understand how different pictorial elements convey the meaning of film . There are several examples in film history where image was even more than just a key element of film ( i.e. pre WWII avant - garde films , Italian neorealism , film noir , etc . ) . However today in most narrative films ( Fictional film ) we try to hide pictorial elements from audience and mask pictorial elements behind the story . In such films it is usually difficult ( if not event pointless ) to analyze image as such . We therefore more often tend to observe various othe",

 The 1910s saw the origins of Hollywood as the centre of the American film industry relocated from New York to California . By 1912 , major motion - picture companies had set up production near or in Los Angeles . In the early 1900s , most motion picture patents were held by Thomas Edison 's Motion Picture Patents Company in New Jersey , and filmmakers were often sued to stop filmmakers productions . To escape sued , filmmakers began moving out west , where Thomas Edison 's patents could not be enforced . Also , the weather was ideal and there was quick access to various settings . Los Angeles became the capital of the American film industry . 

 During the First World War the film industries of Europe were devastated , and Hollywood replaced the French and Italian firms as the most popular film makers in the world .

 The INFITEC or Wavelength Multiplex Technology ( WMT ) is based on the fact that the visible light spectrum can be divided into different wavelength ranges using steep - edged optical filters . Some of different wavelength ranges are presented to the left eye , the others to the right eye . By an appropriate design of the transmission spectra of steep - edged optical filters it can be ensured that both eyes are reached by wavelengths in the red , green , and blue range of the visible light , so both eyes will see a fully colored image . Such multi - bandpass optical filters can currently be made only as so called interference filters .

Inclusive definitions allow for major studio productions , especially box office bombs , while exclusive definitions focus more on obscure , transgressive films shunned by the mainstream .   The difficulty in defining the term and subjectivity of what qualifies as a cult film mirror classificatory disputes about art .   The term cult film the term was first used in the 1970s to describe the culture that surrounded underground films and midnight movies , though cult was in common use in film analysis for decades prior to that .

0,"A film genre is a stylistic or thematic category for motion pictures based on similarities either in the narrative elements , aesthetic approach , or the emotional response to the film . Drawing heavily from the theories of literary - genre criticism , film genres are usually delineated by "" conventions , iconography , settings , narratives , characters and actors . "" One can also classify films by the tone , theme / topic , mood , format , target audience , or budget . the tone , theme / topic , mood , format , target audience , or budget are most evident in genre films , which are "" commercial feature films [ that ] , through repetition and variation , tell familiar stories with familiar characters and familiar situations "" in a given genre . A film 's genre will influence the use of filmmaking styles and techniques , such as the use of flashbacks and low - key lighting in film noir ; tight framing in horror films ; or   fonts that look like rough - hewn logs for the titles of Western films . In addition , genres have associated film - scoring conventions , such as lush string orchestras for romantic melodramas or electronic music for science - fiction films . Genre also affects how films are broadcast on television , advertised , and organized in video - rental stores . Alan Williams distinguishes three main genre categories : narrative , avant - garde , and documentary . With the proliferation of particular genres , film subgenres can also emerge : the legal drama , for example , is a sub - genre of drama that includes courtroom- and trial - focused films . Subgenres are often a mixture of two separate genres ; genres can also merge with seemingly unrelated ones to form hybrid genres , where popular combinations include the romantic comedy and the action comedy film . Broader examples include the docufiction and docudrama , which merge the basic categories of fiction and non - fiction ( documentary).Genres are not fixed ; they change and evolve over time , and some genres may largely disappear ( for example , the melodrama ) .

 The decade of the 2000s in film saw the resurgence of several genres . Fantasy film franchises dominated the box office with The Lord of the Rings , Harry Potter , Pirates of the Caribbean , the Star Wars prequel trilogy ( beginning in 1999 ) , The Chronicles of Narnia , etc . Comic book superhero films became a mainstream blockbuster genre following the releases of X - Men , Unbreakable , and Spider - Man . Gladiator similarly sparked the revival of epic films , while the Bollywood - inspired Moulin Rouge ! did the same for musical films in the Western world , where Indian musicals such as Lagaan and Devdas also began gaining mainstream exposure . Hong Kong fight choreographers like Yuen Woo - ping continued Hong Kong fight choreographers like Yuen Woo - ping influence in Hollywood with such martial arts films as Kill Bill : Volume 1 and Kill Bill : Volume 2 .

Worldwide , RealD 3D is installed in more than 26,500 auditoriums by approximately 1,200 exhibitors in 72 countries as of June 2015 . 


 = = Technology = = 

 RealD 3D cinema technology is a polarized 3D system that uses circularly polarized light to produce stereoscopic image projection . The advantage of circular polarization over linear polarization is that viewers are able to tilt viewers head and look about the theater naturally without seeing double or darkened images . However , as with other systems , any significant head tilt will result in incorrect parallax and prevent the brain from correctly fusing the stereoscopic images . 
 The high - resolution , digital cinema grade video projector alternately projects right - eye frames and left - eye frames , switching between right - eye frames and left - eye frames 144 times per second . The high - resolution , digital cinema grade video projector is either a Texas Instruments Digital Light Processing device or Sony 's reflective LCOS ( liquid crystal on silicon ) . A push - pull electro - optical liquid crystal modulator called a ZScreen is placed immediately in front of the projector lens to alternately polarize each frame . A push - pull electro - optical liquid crystal modulator called a ZScreen circularly polarizes each frame clockwise for the right eye and counter - clockwise for the left eye . The audience wears circularly polarized glasses that have oppositely polarized lenses that ensures each eye sees only each eye designated frame . In RealD 3D , each frame is projected three times to reduce flicker , a system called triple flash . The source video is usually produced at 24 frames per second per eye ( total 48 frames / s ) , which may result in subtle ghosting and stuttering on horizontal camera movements . A silver screen is used to maintain the light polarization upon reflection and to reduce reflection loss to counter some of the significant light loss due to polarization filter absorption . The result is a 3D picture that see",

While this last magazine is not strictly necessary for Steadicam , usage of other magazine types may require frequent rebalancing of the rig in between takes due to weight shifting as the film progressively moves from one side of the magazine to the other .

0,"First - dollar gross is a practice in filmmaking in which the participant receives a percentage of the gross box office revenue starting from a film 's first day of release . The participant begins sharing in the profits from the first ticket sale , not waiting until the film studio turns a profit . First - dollar gross is a film finance and distribution term used primarily in the United States film industry . In France , as of September 2003 , one condition for filmmakers to get government support is that money must be reimbursed on the first - dollar gross basis . First - dollar gross has become a rare arrangement , and compensation has increasingly shifted away from first - dollar gross to back - end compensation . Some contracts define "" first dollar "" as a net figure after certain expense deductions rather than a true distributor 's gross .

 If a film does well , a first - dollar gross arrangement can be very lucrative for the participant . Natalie Wood took 10 percent of the first - dollar gross on Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice , which according to Freddie Fields earned Natalie Wood more money than Natalie Wood did on any other movie . Cameron Diaz negotiated first - dollar gross on Bad Teacher , and netted $ 42 million . Sandra Bullock made more from Sandra Bullock 15 percent first - dollar gross deal on Gravity than from Sandra Bullock upfront pay of $ 20 million . In Arnold Schwarzenegger heyday , Arnold Schwarzenegger received 25 percent first - dollar gross . When Warner Bros. thought Inception was a risky investment , Leonardo DiCaprio agreed to cut Leonardo DiCaprio then normal $ 20 million salary to a minimal salary with a first - dollar gross to make the film , which eventually paid Leonardo DiCaprio $ 50 million . Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg shared a 40 percent first - dollar gross on Saving Private Ryan . Some other filmmakers known to have made first - dollar gross deals are Tyler Perry , Eli Roth , Clint Eastwood , Quentin Tarantino , Christopher Nolan ,   actor Tom Cruise , and film producer Jason Blum .

 What is now called Foley originated as adding sounds to live broadcasts of radio drama from radio studios around the world in the early 1920s . Phonograph recordings of the era were not of sufficient quality or flexibility to faithfully reproduce most sound effects on cue , so a sound effects person had to create all sounds for radio plays live . sound - effects artist Jack Foley started working with Universal Studios in 1914 during the silent movie era . When Warner studios released The Jazz Singer , Warner studios first film to include sound , Universal Studios knew Universal Studios needed to stay competitive and called for any employees who had radio experience to come forward . sound - effects artist Jack Foley became part of the sound crew that turned Universal Studios then - upcoming "" silent "" musical Show Boat into a musical .

0,"Film theory is a set of scholarly approaches within the academic discipline of film or cinema studies that began in the 1920s by questioning the formal essential attributes of motion pictures ; and that now provides conceptual frameworks for understanding film 's relationship to reality , the other arts , individual viewers , and society at large . Film theory is not to be confused with general film criticism , or film history , though these three disciplines interrelate .

 = = History = = 
 French philosopher Henri Bergson 's Matter and Memory ( 1896 ) anticipated the development of film theory during the birth of cinema in the early twentieth century . French philosopher Henri Bergson 's commented on the need for new ways of thinking about movement , and coined the terms "" the movement - image "" and "" the time - image "" . However , in French philosopher Henri Bergson 's 1906 essay L'illusion cinématographique ( in L'évolution créatrice ; English : The cinematic illusion ) French philosopher Henri Bergson 's rejects film as an example of what French philosopher Henri Bergson 's had in mind . Nonetheless , decades later , in Cinéma I and Cinema II ( 1983–1985 ) , the philosopher Gilles Deleuze took Matter and Memory as the basis of the philosopher Gilles Deleuze philosophy of film and revisited French philosopher Henri Bergson 's concepts , combining French philosopher Henri Bergson 's concepts with the semiotics of Charles Sanders Peirce . 
 Early film theory arose in the silent era and was mostly concerned with defining the crucial elements of the medium . Early film theory largely evolved from the works of directors like Germaine Dulac , Louis Delluc , Jean Epstein , Sergei Eisenstein , Lev Kuleshov , and Dziga Vertov and film theorists like Rudolf Arnheim , Béla Balázs and Siegfried Kracauer . These thinkers emphasized how film differed from reality and how film might be considered a valid art form . In the years after World War II , the French film critic and theorist André Bazin reacted against this approach to the cinema , arguing that film 's essence lay in film 's ability to mechanically reproduce",

 Electronovision was an entirely separate and more advanced process from the earlier Electronicam , used by the DuMont Television Network in the 1950s to telecast live TV shows with electronic cameras , while simultaneously filming the production with a film camera attached to the side of the video camera . That process had been used on TV series broadcast by the DuMont Television Network as well as the "" Classic 39 "" half - hour version of The Honeymooners that aired on CBS in the 1955–56 television season , allowing the producers to archive a high - quality film negative for reruns . 
 While the press releases on Electronovision were deliberately vague , perhaps to add more mystique to Electronovision , Electronovision used conventional analog Image Orthicon video camera tube units , shooting in the B&W 819-line interlaced 25fps French video standard . the B&W 819-line interlaced 25fps French video standard was used as Ampex high - band quadruplex video tape recorders ( VTR ) were able to record the B&W 819-line interlaced 25fps French video standard when equipped with proper version of Intersync module .

In 1888 , Eugène - Louis Doyen ( French surgeon ) had Eugène - Louis Doyen ( French surgeon ) surgeries captured on film . Eugène - Louis Doyen ( French surgeon ) films were brought into disrepute by the fact that Eugène - Louis Doyen ( French surgeon ) films were copied and shown on fairgrounds .

For example , in 1910 someone said the following regarding Eugène - Louis Doyen ( French surgeon ) films : , “ Eugène - Louis Doyen ( French surgeon ) films savoured of advertisement , and were never popular , save as a side show among the less scientifically inclined members of the profession . ”    Eugène - Louis Doyen ( French surgeon ) work , however , marked the distinction between the concepts of ‘ film for entertainment ’ versus ‘ film for medicine ’ .

The Dolby application of optical matrix encoding in 1976 ( released on the film , Logan 's Run ) did not use split surrounds , and thus was not 5.1 .

Cellulose nitrate has been the cause of many fires and losses of motion picture films , photographic materials , and archival records .

 Cellulose acetate is also known as "" safety "" film and started to replace nitrate film in still photography in the 1920s . There are several types of acetate that were produced after 1925 , which include diacetate ( circa 1923-circa 1955 ) , acetate propionate ( 1927-circa 1949 ) , acetate butyrate ( 1936-present ) , and triacetate ( circa 1950-present ) . The earliest , diacetate , was found to be inferior to nitrate because diacetate had high shrinkage rates . Eastman Kodak then worked with mixed esters of cellulose to create acetate butyrate and acetate propionate , which were used for sheet film , X - rays , amateur roll film , and aerial maps , but acetate butyrate and acetate propionate were still found to be inferior to nitrate by the motion picture industry . Triacetate was then produced and is still in production for roll film today .

A Beatscript or beat - script offers a level of detail not afforded by the standard feature - film screenplay format . offers makes A Beatscript or beat - script especially useful for describing short film , animation and short sequence ideas . 
 A Beatscript or beat - script structure is focused on action rather than thought . focused allows screenwriters to organise screenwriters narrative ideas in a concise manner that is conducive to screen presentation . focused prevents authors from describing non - tangible , subjective elements that are unable to be effectively represented in screen form . 
 Beatscripts are used as the starting - point for generating storyboards and shooting - scripts . While beats are used to describe action , shots are used to describe the visual screen presentation of action . 
 The relationship between individual beats and shots is not direct . In situations , where an event is significant in a sequence , a single beat might equate to a single shot ( and is likely to be framed as a close - up ) . Whereas a series of beats might describe a general idea , a series of beats might collectively equate to a single shot ( which is likely to be framed as a long - shot ) . The specific visual treatment of beatscript ideas is usually determined by the cinematographer or director ( which on small projects is usually the same person ) .

 World cinema has an unofficial implication of films with "" artistic value "" as opposed to "" Hollywood commercialism . "" Foreign language films are often grouped with "" art house films "" and other independent films in DVD stores , cinema listings etc . 
 Unless dubbed into one 's native language , foreign language films played in English - speaking regions usually have English subtitles . Few films of this kind receive more than a limited release and many are never played in major cinemas . As such the marketing , popularity and gross takings for foreign language films played in English - speaking regions are usually markedly less than for typical Hollywood blockbusters . The combination of subtitles and minimal exposure adds to the notion that "" World Cinema "" has an inferred artistic prestige or intelligence , which may discourage less sophisticated viewers . Additionally , differences in cultural style and tone between foreign and domestic films affects attendance at cinemas and DVD sales . Foreign language films can be commercial , low brow or B - movies .

0,"Catharsis ( from Greek κάθαρσις , katharsis , meaning "" purification "" or "" cleansing "" or "" clarification "" ) is the purification and purgation of emotions — particularly pity and fear — through art or any extreme change in emotion that results in renewal and restoration . Catharsis is a metaphor originally used by Aristotle in the Poetics , comparing the effects of tragedy on the mind of a spectator to the effect of catharsis on the body . 


 = = Dramatic uses = = 
 Catharsis is a term in dramatic art that describes the effect of tragedy ( or comedy and quite possibly other artistic forms ) principally on the audience ( although some have speculated on characters in the drama as well ) . Nowhere does Aristotle explain the meaning of "" catharsis "" as Aristotle is using "" catharsis "" in the definition of tragedy in the Poetics ( 1449b21 - 28 ) . G. F. Else argues that traditional , widely held interpretations of "" catharsis "" as "" purification "" or "" purgation "" have no basis in the text of the Poetics , but are derived from the use of "" catharsis "" in other Aristotelian and non - Aristotelian contexts . For this reason , a number of diverse interpretations of the meaning of "" catharsis "" have arisen . "" catharsis "" is often discussed along with Aristotle 's concept of anagnorisis . 
 D. W. Lucas , in an authoritative edition of the Poetics , comprehensively covers the various nuances inherent in the meaning of "" catharsis "" in an Appendix devoted to "" Pity , Fear , and Katharsis "" . D. W. Lucas recognizes the possibility of "" catharsis "" bearing some aspect of the meaning of "" purification , purgation , and ' intellectual clarification , ' "" although D. W. Lucas approach to purification , purgation , and ' intellectual clarification differs in some ways from that of other influential scholars . In particular , D. W. Lucas interpretation is based on "" the Greek doctrine of Humours , "" which has not received wide subsequent acceptance . The conception of catharsis in terms of purgation and purification remains in wide use today , as The conception of catharsis in terms of purgation and purification has for centuries . However , since the twentieth century , the interpretation of "" catharsis "" as "" intellectual cla",

0,"2D to 3D video conversion ( also called 2D to stereo 3D conversion and stereo conversion ) is the process of transforming 2D ( "" flat "" ) film to 3D form , which in almost all cases is stereo , so 2D to 3D video conversion is the process of creating imagery for each eye from one 2D image . 


 = = Overview = = 
 2D to 3D video conversion adds the binocular disparity depth cue to digital images perceived by the brain , thus , if done properly , greatly improving the immersive effect while viewing stereo video in comparison to 2D video . However , in order to be successful , 2D to 3D video conversion should be done with sufficient accuracy and correctness : the quality of 2D ( "" flat "" ) film should not deteriorate , and the binocular disparity depth cue should not contradict other cues used by the brain for depth perception . If done properly and thoroughly , 2D to 3D video conversion produces stereo video of similar quality to "" native "" stereo video which is shot in stereo and accurately adjusted and aligned in post - production . Two approaches to stereo conversion can be loosely defined : quality semiautomatic conversion for cinema and high quality 3DTV , and low - quality automatic conversion for cheap 3DTV , VOD and similar applications . 


 = = = Re - rendering of computer animated films = = = 
 Computer animated 2D films made with 3D models can be re - rendered in stereoscopic 3D by adding a second virtual camera if the original data is still available . re is technically not a conversion ; therefore , such re - rendered films have the same quality as films originally produced in stereoscopic 3D. Examples of re include the re - release of Toy Story and Toy Story 2 . Revisiting the original computer data for Toy Story and Toy Story 2 took four months , as well as an additional six months to add the 3D. However , not all CGI films are re - rendered for the re - release of Toy Story and Toy Story 2 because of the costs , time required , lack of skilled resources or missing computer data .
